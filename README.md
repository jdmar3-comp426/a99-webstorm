# Blackjack

Welcome to this simplified version of BlackJack! It's a universally known card game in which you will be using a deck of 52 cards to compete the dealer. You and dealer(robot) will each get an initial hand of two cards to start. The J K Q will each acount for 10 points and A will be regarded as 11 (not 1 for this simplified version). You can choose either to hit one card (get one from the deck) or stand with what you have in hands. Winner is the one with higher total points but not exceeding 21, which it will bust and lose. You will need to have an account to enjoy this game.
