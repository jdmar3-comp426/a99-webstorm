# Database

The name of our database is users.db and due to the nature of our game, we only have one table "accountInfo" recording all the required user informations.

It has five attributes except for the auto-increasing primary key. They are username, password, emailAddress, lastLogin, numOfGames. Most of them pretty self explain their meanings. lastLogin stands for the last time this player enter the game and numOfGames simply stands for the number of games he or she has played in total.
